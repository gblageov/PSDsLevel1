			<h1>First let me ask you (h1)</h1>
			<p>Are you tired of rejection? Of reaching out to hundreds of prospects and getting <strong>NOTHING</strong>
				back? Of being pushed to the side by competitors who win business with a solution that’s
				<strong>WORSE</strong> than yours? I know how it feels… I was in your shoes once. </p>

			<h2>Everyone is chasing the same set of leads. (h2)</h2>
			<p><a href="#">CTOsOnTheMove</a> sends you a real-time email alert and the updated email of that IT
				executive. You engage that IT executive in a meaningful business conversation leading to a sale</p>
			<h2>Here’s how <a href="#">CTOsOnTheMove</a> works: (h2)</h2>
			<p>Now is it a good thing? These thousands of customers are essentially chasing the same pool of leads.
				So if you are an IT executive with budget authority, how many canned pitches you think you get a day?
				10? 20? How about 30+?
			</p>
			<h3>Generic sales pitches (h3)</h3>
			<p>I don’t know about you, but most of sales pitches I see go something along the lines: <strong>“Hey, IT
					executive! In case you need, we are the best.”</strong> This is not personalized and not
				contextual.<strong>Hence, it doesn’t work.</strong>

			<h3>Lots of marketing activity, yet no results (h3)</h3>

			<h6>Marketing spent is not an investment but a liability (h6)</h6>
			<p>If I get pitched unskillfully by a certain person and company, I begin to transfer this negative impression onto this company’s product or service, thus diminishing the future chances of my ever becoming their client.</p>
