            <p>The first letter of the article has its own style to look like a print publication with 10 px padding between the letter and the paragraph.  You know when you’ve randomly hung out a bunch of times with somebody and you know friends, but you never really reach out to each other for whatever reason or another, and then the stars finally align, you hang out, and it’s incredibly awesome?</p>
            <p>Yup, he's single.</p>

            <p>Totally had that this weekend.  My buddy Doug’s older brother Chris is doing a med school rotation in Seattle and came down to Porty to experience the weird.</p>
            <p>And experience it we did.</p>
            <p>Friday night we met up with my meditation buddy Jake and went to a New-Age electo jam band “Lotus” concert at the Crystal Ballroom, happy vibes and light show included.  There’s a weird intensity to this much happiness.  It fills the room like a cloud of moisture, but not like it bogged me down – more like I was really refreshed.  This was one of the most positively charged things I’ve ever experienced. There were smiles everywhere, and some of them even had people attached.  Such a happy show.  So much fun.  It also helps that the Crystal Ballroom has bouncy dance floor, so when the crowd starts to jump to the beat just right, the ballroom turns into a huge wooden trampoline.  Stomps hit the ground to the beat, like we were all collectively just another percussionist in the band, and I found myself lost in it all.</p>

            <p>And this was not elevator music volume.  The bathroom speakers were blasting that shit while I was… well…  So incredible.  We ended the night with a couple beers, stories of mistaken nipple shaving, and a killer breakfast in which I ate a gyro omelette.  So good.</p>
            <p>Funny how the weekends with the least expectation turn out to be the ones you’ll never forget. Oh, and I didn’t get a chance to mention Jake’s show.  Saw him play some acoustic stuff on Thursday at a kava house and he rocked.  Captivating voice and strums la chitarra oh-so-fine.</p>

            <blockquote>This is a quote style.  If you’re looking for some good acoustic stuff, check out his Soundcloud.  He’s got a killer band putting together some rad music thats genre is an electronic style of rock funkyness I’ve never heard before.  </blockquote>
            <p>Good day to you all fine people.  I flew through this post so if it’s rushed or hurried or sounds like I’m doing ten things at once while writing it, my grandest of apologies.  Time to get back to the chess novel.</p>
